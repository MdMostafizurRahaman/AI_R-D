Our non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items: Foreign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 using the prior year\\'s monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance. Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94-99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will\n",

While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.

      " Meta Reports First Quarter 2024 Results MENLO PARK, Calif. – April 24, 2024 – Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. \"It's been a good start to the year,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. \"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is another step towards building the world's leading AI. We're seeing healthy growth across our apps and we continue making steady progress building the metaverse as well.\" First Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights Three Months Ended March 31, % Change In millions, except percentages and per share amounts 2024 2023 Revenue $ 36,455 $ 28,645 27 % Costs and expenses 22,637 21,418 6 % Income from operations $ 13,818 $ 7,227 91 % Operating margin 38 % 25 % Provision for income taxes $ 1,814 $ 1,598 14 % Effective tax rate 13 % 22 % Net income $ 12,369 $ 5,709 117 % Diluted earnings per share (EPS) $ 4.71 $ 2.20 114 % First Quarter 2024 Operational and Other Financial Highlights • Family daily active people (DAP) – DAP was 3.24 billion on average for March 2024, an increase of 7% year-over- year. • Ad impressions – Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 20% year-over-year. • Average price per ad – Average price per ad increased by 6% year-over-year. • Revenue – Total revenue and revenue on a constant currency basis were $36.46 billion and $36.35 billion, respectively, both of which increased by 27% year-over-year. • Costs and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $22.64 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. • Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.72 billion. • Capital return program – Share repurchases were $14.64 billion of our Class A common stock and dividends payments were $1.27 billion. • Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $58.12 billion as of March 31, 2024. Free cash flow was $12.53 billion. • Headcount – Headcount was 69,329 as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of 10% year-over-year. 1 CFO Outlook Commentary We expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-39 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94-99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will\n"
